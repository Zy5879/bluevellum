        Due to the limited size of our business and inventory most of our items
        are made on demand. Once your order is shipped, you will receive an
        email notification with your tracking information. I will do my best to
        keep the turn around time to a minimum. Blue Vellum LLC will not be held
        accountable for lost goods due to incorrect information provided by
        customer i.e incorrect shipping address provided. Once package is
        delivered to customer provided address all accountability is released
        from Blue Vellum LLC.
